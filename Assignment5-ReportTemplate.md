# Introduction
The main purpose of this lab was to help us discover the reliability assessment and the usage of the tools such as C-SFRAT and the Reliability Demonstration Chart with the help of Excel. This lab assignment also explored the failure reliability growth testing which helps analyze the product’s changes over a period of time. Additionally, this lab also introduced to us the concept of failure data which is critical to analyze as it can aid us in determining how to prevent future failures. Overall, these new concepts solidified the theoretical lectures helped us understand where reliability testing plays its role in software testing procedures.

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 
# Result of model comparison (selecting top two models)
In this section of the lab assignment, we had to select the best two models using the failure data provided to us the benefit of using the C-SFRAT was that we could simply import the CSV file into this GUI and we could using the functions to determine which fits in well with our data, this feature of Model Results and Predictions it will enable us to narrow which function resembles the closest to the failure data. To approach finding the best two models we select all the possible comparisons we could perform with the covariates. 
# Result of range analysis (an explanation of which part of the data is good for proceeding with the analysis)
